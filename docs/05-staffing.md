# Staffing Plan (MVP-First, scale path)

All FTE are **AI First** fast-paced engineers, leveraging vibe coding tools such as GitHub copilot, cursor and LLMs

## AI First Engineer — Core Skills
 - GitHub Copilot/Cursor: setup, scaffold → implement → test → refactor loop; repo-wide context; disciplined reviews and validate generated code
 - Prompt engineering: role+goal+constraints, few-shot examples, self-critique, small relevant context, test-first prompts.
 - Unit tests & TDD support - Eg., Ask copilot to generate tests and mocks
 - LLM selection: pick for task (code, reasoning, long-context, multimodal), balance cost/latency/quality, plan fallbacks.
 - Code generation & refactoring - GPT-class code models, Claude-code, Code Llama, StarCoder; pick based on language support, context length, latency, and cost.
 - Day-to-Day Playbook - Design,code,Ops,Docs and Review output and validate
 - Governance: security/PII, license checks, auditability
